# Features of VS-CODE : 
  ---

* __Visual Studio Code CLI__ : Basically it is a powerful comand line interface which let you control how you launch the editor.By the use of CLI you can open files, install extensions, change the diplay language and output diagnostics.

* __Git Integration__ : VS-Code comes with integrated Git that allows us for adding, committing, pulling and pushing changes to a remote Git repository using a simple GUI.

* __Integrated Terminal__ : In VS-CODE, you can open an integrated terminal, initially starting at the roof of your workspace. This can be very convenient as you don't have to switch windows or alter the state of an existing terminal to perform a quick command line task.

* __Live Share__ : Live Share enables you to collaboratively edit and debug with others in real time, regardless what programming languages you're using or app types you're building.

* __Plugins and Themes__ : Visual Studio Code has a rich plugin API, and this has enabled developers to create really awesome plugins. I'll list a few common ones which I've used, but to get a comprehensive list, you can look at the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
