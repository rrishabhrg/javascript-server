# Features of VS-CODE : 
=====================

* __Visual Studio Code CLI__ : Visual Studio Code comes with an inbuilt Command Line Interface. Once you've installed Visual Studio Code, and have it open, press ⇧⌘P to open the command palette for Mac, or just ⌘P and the press > button.

* __Git Integration__ : Sometimes using Git can be fun or hard, but Visual Studio Code comes with integrated Git that allows for Adding, Committing, Pulling and Pushing Changes to a remote Git repository using a simple GUI.


* __Debugging__ : Visual Studio Code has a rich API for enabling debugging tools, Here are some articles here in scotch referencing them.

 Debugging is a large topic, and is usually language/stack specific. Depending on the language you are using, there are available plugins that enable support for debugging, and you'll be able to use breakpoints to debug your code when developing.

* __Integrated Terminal__ : Most of the time when running code, there's usually a terminal open either to the side, or somewhere in your machine.

* __Plugins and Themes__ : Visual Studio Code has a rich plugin API, and this has enabled developers to create really awesome plugins. I'll list a few common ones which I've used, but to get a comprehensive list, you can look at the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
